# Easywhitelist for EXILED

EasyWhitelist is a plugin designed to simplify whitelist management without requiring a server restart. Players can be added either by their in-game username (which will automatically assign their SteamID upon joining) or by their SteamID directly. The plugin offers flexible configuration options, including the ability to set whether the whitelist should be active at server startup, as well as the ability to enable, disable, or reload the whitelist at any time.
